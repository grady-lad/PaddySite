USE CASES.

As a user of whereswallie I would like to register to the website so I can use it to find spots to skate. 
	> We need to be able to create a user. What details do we collect? 
	    -> Name (first and last) , Email, Country, City. Picture (optional leave for finishing touches).

-> Define POST methods for adding a user. | Status = completed
-> Create POST methods. | Status =  completed
-> Create GET methods. | Status = completed
-> Write tests. | Status = not started.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes: 

Found a great article online (scotch.io) to create an app that allows for user login & signup
GOD SEND !!!!
-------- BUT --------------
The project is a mess!!!! 
So what needs to be done now is refactor the project to a standardized login signup boilerplate. 
Also I really need to read up on passport session storing best practises and how the hell it all exactly works!

Lastly I need to see how to upload images and display them ina gallery if I can do this I will try paddys website 

I have two out of the three core functionality bits completed. How hard can it be? (CSS UGGGGGGGHHHHHH)

Once the all this is done where do I go from here? 

Create a decent front end for what I have so far? or continue on with the backend :) get the fourm functionality working
then look into how to notify users and how to search for fourms with layout etc. Maybe this site wont be so hard after all !
